# simple-csp
I want to make a simple CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem) here, coded in Python. My objective is to create an n * n grid, with each square in the grid having a number from 1 - n. The constraint is that there only be 1 of the same number in every column and row (and potentially diagonally later on).
